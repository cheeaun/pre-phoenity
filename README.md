Pre-phoenity web site
===

I call this the "pre-Phoenity" web site because it was built around 2002, before there was `phoenity.com` and the Firefox browser was still called 'Phoenix'. If my memory serves me right, the site was hosted on `freewebz.com/phoenity` or probably some other free web hosts out there.

And now it's here.

Note that most links are broken and pardon the Web 1.0 design.
